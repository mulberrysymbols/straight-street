<a href='http://straight-street.com'>Straight-street.com</a> provides the Mulberry symbols designed for users of AAC or with other accessibility communications requirements. A key feature is that the symbols are peer reviewed by SLTs and are on the liberal <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/'>CC BY-SA licence</a> which allows copying and derivation. This makes the symbols ideal for use in web applications and the  API enables developers to create innovative software solutions and mashups that use the master symbol set managed by straight-street.com.

This project is the website code which includes
  * A simple gallery for the Mulberry symbol set with facilities to browse and select
  * Symbol download facilities
  * A peer review process for new symbols
  * Various admin, process and reporting features
  * Some internationalisation

The API is another project and can be found in the links on the left.
