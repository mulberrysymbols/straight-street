<h2>General questions:</h2>

<div class="h3" id="give" title="give">
<h3>Can I give the symbols away?</h3>
<p>Yes, once you have downloaded the symbols, you can copy them (to CD-Rom perhaps) and pass them on to your friends and colleagues. Remember that the license is associated with the original symbols and any copies in perpetuity.
</p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="alter" title="alter">
<h3>Am I allowed to alter the symbols?</h3>
<p>Yes, and you can distribute those too, but Remember the license is associated these symbols in perpetuity, including any derivatives that you might make.  You might decide, for example, to change the colours on some symbols, perhaps to suit a particular user who has a colour-blindness.</p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="privacy" title="privacy">
<h3>Who can see my personal details?</h3>
<p>No one.  We will not distribute any personal details or make them public.  The only information people can see about you is your UserID (which can be as anonymous as you like, although many people use the convention 
	<br/>XxxxxY<br/>
(where Xxxxxx is your first name and Y the initial letter of your surname). This appears in any forum discussions.  
Secondly, if you choose to, your "role" can be made public (for example "Speech and Language therapist").  See "My Info" on the main user panel, which becomes visible once you have logged in.</p>

<h2>How-to:</h2>

<div class="h3" id="userid" title="userid">
<h3>I need to change my UserID - how do I do that?</h3>
<p>The UserID is unique - no one else can choose the same name.  We will be making this something you can change, but in the meantime please <a href="/contact.php?subject=Request%20id%20change">contact us</a> and we'll change it for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="email" title="email">
<h3>How do I change my email address?</h3>
<p>We will be making this something you can change, but in the meantime please <a href="/contact.php?subject=Request%20email%20change">contact us</a> and we'll change it for you.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="h2" id="general-questions" title="general-questions">
<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
<div class="h3" id="symbols" title="symbols">
<h3>I downloaded the symbols but I can't find them on my PC.</h3>
<p>On a Windows PC, they are installed into
	<br/>C:/Program Files/Straight Street/Symbols/Mulberry Symbol Set</p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="registering" title="registering">
<h3>I had trouble Registering - what did I do wrong?</h3>
<p>You should receive an error message.  If this did not make sense, please <a href="/contact.php?subject=Trouble%20registering">contact us</a>.  Typical problems are:
	- you chose a UserID that already exists.
	- Spam filters at your organisation or home blocked the 
	authentication email.   Let us know and we can activate from 
	here.</p>

<h2>Developer and Contributor questions:</h2>
<div class="h3" id="developer" title="developer">
<h3>I'm a developer - can I write some apps for you?</h3>
<p>Yes, in the past we developed everything in Borland Delphi, but we will accept any programming language.  For us it is more about the suitability of your application and how it fits in with ours.  We might refer you on to the OATS website where you will find a much broader range of applications relating to accessibility.  Please note that all our application developers are volunteers, and you will need to allow your code to be distributed under the GNU GPL license.  Of course we will need to vet the application first. </p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="webdesigner" title="webdesigner">
<h3>I am a web designer - how can I contribute?</h3>
<p>We are always looking to develop our website further. Please note that all our web site developers are volunteers, and the site is written in PHP/CSS/mySQL.   </p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="photographer" title="photographer">
<h3>I am a photographer - can I donate some photos?</h3>
<p>Yes. We have a specification for the photos we distribute, which you can find in the User Guides section.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="h2" id="general-questions" title="general-questions">
<h2>Commercial Questions:</h2>
<div class="h3" id="distribute" title="distribute">
<h3>Can I distribute these symbols as part of my own product?</h3>
<p>Yes, as long as you are giving your own product away free of cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="h3" id="selling" title="selling">
<h3>Can I make money out of these symbols by selling them?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you need to use a different license. Please <a href="/contact.php?subject=Commercial%20question">contact us</a> for more guidance.</p>
